Kitchen's pinky3 dvorak keymap.

Despite my usual desire to have the keyboard send qwerty codes and I map things to dvorak in software on whatever computer I'm at, it makes using the qmk configurator very confusing because I have to map things in my brain and tbh, it's just too much of a hassle.

Setting the layout to US in macos lets me set the keyboard up to do what I mean, and that is great. When I want to switch to using the built-in keyboard on the laptop, I can easily switch to the other layout. No big deal.
