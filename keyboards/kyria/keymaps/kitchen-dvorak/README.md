this is my custom keymap for my kyria.

I ported it over from my pinky3 keymap and it was heavily inspired by the default keymap for the planck ez.

It uses 4 layers, one for normal things, one for shifted symbols, one for unshifted symbols and numbers, and a 4th utility layer.

Yes, cmd and backspace on the same key get me in trouble some times because I'll accidentally cmd-a backspace, but fortunately that seems to be mostly a thing of the past. I think there are some different default settings for key repeating and such in the kyria that are different than the pinky3 that make that friendlier, like I can hold backspace now and have it delete multiple things. It's neat.

I'm a mac user so the utility layer has a lot of mac specific things like `cmd-\`` and tab and browser history navigation. I really like the arrow keys on the right hand, for some reason they just feel really nice. I'm an emacs user but I use vim keybindings but also dvorak so my hjkl keys are all over the place, but this inverted T in the middle of the right hand on a layer is just :chefkiss:

In the future since I have an extra thumb key on the right hand that I'm not currently using, I am thinking about adding a spanish layer to make typing accented vowels and such easier but I also need to figure out how to do that properly in emacs since it takes over the meta key which normally is what you use for that (one reason I'm interested in figuring out how to make that easier on my keyboard natively)

I also hope to make this compatible with the dvorak software layout at some point so when I switch from kyria to laptop built in keyboard I don't need to also change the keyboard layout in software which I often forget to do as I'm typing my password and wondering after the 5th attempt why it's not working. It's an easy change, I think, but I think it also makes it no longer compatible with the qmk configurator, which I like to use, so ... we'll see, though.
